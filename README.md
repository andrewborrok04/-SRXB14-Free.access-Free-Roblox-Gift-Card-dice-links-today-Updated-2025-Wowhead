1. How do you redeem a Roblox gift card?
The best and only way to redeem a Roblox gift card is to use your browser to visit the redemption page on Roblox.com. Enter the PIN from the gift card and select ‚ÄúRedeem‚Äù to add credit to your account!

2. Where can you buy this gift card?
Physical cards are available worldwide at major retailers, but you can also get online cards through Amazon, GameStop, Walmart, Target, and the Roblox site.

3. How do I check my gift card balance?
You can check your balance in two ways! If you‚Äôre going through the membership purchase page, the balance appears in green numbers on the right side of the page. You can also use the Gift Card Redemption page to check the balance, which you can find in green numbers under the ‚ÄúRedeem‚Äù button.

4. What can I use my gift card on?
Gift cards can go towards the purchase of Robux, a form of virtual money that you can use to pay for in-app purchases and upgrades to your favorite games. You can also use the gift card to upgrade to a Premium subscription, which gives you more privileges, goodies, and access to the millions of games available through Roblox! How cool is that? However, gift cards purchased through Amazon only grant Robux and cannot be used towards Premium subscriptions.

5. Are there parental control options for my kids?
Yes, there are a few things that you can do to protect your kids while they have fun with Roblox.
Restricting their account based on age. Once you set the age on the account, your child will be unable to access content above their age range.
Disabling/restricting chat. By accessing the Privacy Tab, you can restrict who your child can and cannot chat with.
Setting up a 4 digit pin to ensure that your child can't make any changes to the account without the 4 digit pin.
You can also enable ‚ÄúAccount Restrictions‚Äù from the security tab. This will limit the number of games that can be played and who they can chat with.
